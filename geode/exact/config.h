// Multiprecision integer arithmetic for exact geometric predicates
#pragma once

/* Doubles have 52 bits of mantissa, so they can exactly represent any integer in [-2**53,2**53]
 * (52+1 due to the implicit 1 before the mantissa).  Single precision floats can handle
 * [-2**24,2**24].  To give this some context, 25 bit precision in a 10 meter space is an accuracy
 * of 0.3 um.  Ideally, this would be sufficient for our purposes for now.
 *
 * Unfortunately, some algorithms require additional sentinel bits for special purposes, so 2**24
 * is a bit too tight.  Symbolic perturbation of high degree predicates absorbs a few more bits.
 * While its often possible to carefully arrange for single precision to work, double precision is
 * easy and more precise anyways.  Thus, we quantize into the integer range [-2**53,2**53]/1.01.
 * The 1.01 factor gives algorithms a bit of space for sentinel purposes.
